""" 
In a file called working.py, implement a function called convert that expects 
a str in either of the 12-hour formats below and returns the corresponding str 
in 24-hour format (i.e., 9:00 to 17:00). Expect that AM and PM will be 
capitalized (with no periods therein) and that there will be a space before each.

- 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM
- 9 AM to 5 PM

Raise a ValueError instead if the input to convert is not in either of those 
formats or if either time is invalid (e.g., 12:60 AM, 13:00 PM, etc.). But do 
not assume that someoneâ€™s hours will start ante meridiem and end post meridiem; 
someone might work late and even long hours (e.g., 5:00 PM to 9:00 AM).
